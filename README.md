# ManagerGameUnity

A Manager Game made in Unity Engine(In progress), SuperHero Theme

Is my first project, I am student, i improving myself everyday to make this happen!!

Turn-Based Manager, you need checkout your money, to pay your heroes, use heroes to fight the crime, you can see all heros are Scriptable Objects also the contracts and events, simple to modified they. Main script has a overload of variables i miss the orgazination for a design pattern, i gonna try improve this in the future, in this script you have the Day info, money, Hero List, Methods for: the next day,economics,crime calculator,check events, check hero ids for repeated heroes and interact with the others scripts as a instance or a serialized field reference.

you can see other managers like Upgrade manager,Store Manager,Events manager, game Manager(mains_script).
